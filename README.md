# ESP8266_Blynk_Radio
I worked on this to learn working with TEA5767 Radio Module, Blynk app and ESP8266. It works by allowing the user to switch between radio stations on the TEA5767 radio module through the Blynk app. The radio module connects to the Blynk IoT platform through the ESP8266 WiFi module.

Requirments:
1. ESP8266
2. TEA5767
3. Blynk App on your smartphone
4. WiFi with Internet
